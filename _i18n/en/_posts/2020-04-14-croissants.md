recipe:
  servings: 18 croissants
  prep: 40 minutes
  cook: 10-15 minutes
  rest: 2 heures
  ingredients:
    - 500g de farine
    - 200g de beurre
    - 50g de sucre
    - 200ml de lait
    - 10g de levure
    - 2 oeufs
    - 10g de sel
  directions:
    - title: The dough
      directions:
        - Mix the flour, sugar, milk and yeast together. Knead for a few minutes and let it rest for about an hour at room temperature.
        - Knead again to remove the air, and put the dough in the fridge to cool down. It is important the dough remained cold to prevent the butter from melting.
        - Roll the dough on a floured counter to obtain a roughly 30cm by 30cm square. Spread the butter in the center, leaving a margin of a few centimetres.
        - Fold the corners to the centre, and merge the sides together by humidifying them, in order to seal the butter.
    - title: Laminating the dough
      directions:
        - Roll the dough with a rolling pin. Make sure to flour both sides of the dough to avoid any sticking –and butter getting out of the dough.
        - Fold the dough into three, and make a quarter turn.
        - Put the dough back into the fridge for about ten minutes to avoid letting the butter melt.
        - Start the process over twice to obtain a 27-layer laminated dough.
    - title: Preparing the croissants
      directions:
        - Spread the dough on the kitchen counter, into a rectangle of roughly 40cm by 50cm. Cut in half along the length.
        - Cut long triangles (around 10cm-base and 20cm-height).
        - Roll the croissants, starting from the base and ending with the tip, which you can humidify to seal it.
        - If you wish to freeze the croissants, now is a good time. Put them on a baking tray covered with parchment paper. You can put them in a sealed plastic bag once they are frozen.

      directions:
        - Put the croissants on a baking tray covered with parchment paper. Let them de-freeze if needed.
        - Let them rest for about an hour to let the yeast act. Once they have risen, you can paint them with yolk and water to make them more glossy.
        - Bake for 10 to 15 minutes at 210°C.
