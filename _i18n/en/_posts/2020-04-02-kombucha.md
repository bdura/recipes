  directions:
    - title: Starting the “SCOBY”
      directions:
        - Bring two litres of water to a boil and infuse the tea leaves.
        - Remove the tea leaves and add the sugar.
        - Let the mix cool down to below 30°C. You may hasten the cooling by putting the mix in a shut mason jar and emerge it in colder water (be wary of the temperature difference, you do not want to break the glass)...
        - Add the kombucha. Since it is unpasteurised, it still contains the bacteria and yeast colony that will start the SCOBY.
        - Let the mix rest at room temperature, avoiding direct sunlight. Leave the jar open, but put a cloth on the opening. After one to three weeks, a translucent layer will start covering the liquid – that is the SCOBY!

      directions:
        - Prepare the sweet tea and let it cool down, following steps 1 through 3 to start the SCOBY.
        - Mix with around 50cl of kombucha from the previous batch, or some unpasteurised kombucha if you are using the SCOBY for the first time.
        - Place the SCOBY on top of the liquid. You can also pour the sweet tea directly on the SCOBY with some leftover product of the previous batch once the SCOBY is mature enough (after a few weeks). The SCOBY might sink to the bottom of the jar, but that is perfectly fine.
    - title: Second fermentation
      directions:
        - Pour the product of the first fermentation in clean bottle. Add a bit of juice or dry fruit to give it some flavour (eg hibiscus flower of fresh ginger).
        - Let the kombucha ferment a second time for a few days, avoiding direct sunlight. The mix will become sparkling as the carbon dioxide released during the fermentation gets trapped in the bottle.
        - Put in the fridge and enjoy!
