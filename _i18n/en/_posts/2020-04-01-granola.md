recipe:
  servings: 600 g of granola
  prep: 10 minutes
  cook: 20 to 25 minutes
  ingredients:
    - 430 g of big oat flakes
    - around 100 g of nuts and/or seeds
    - 180 g of maple sirup (or honey)
    - 120 g of coco butter
    - one tea spoon of salt
    - one tea spoon of cinnamon
    - a pinch of vanilla extract
  directions:
    - Preheat the oven to 180°C.
    - Combine and stir the flakes, the nuts, the cinnamon, the vanilla extract and the salt.
    - Add the maple sirup and the oil. Mix until the flakes are coated with the mixture.
    - Put the mix onto a flat oven pan covered with parchment paper. Make sure it is well spread.
    - Bake for 20 to 25 minutes at 180°C. Stir again around 12 minutes in to make sure the granola bakes evenly. Spread it again and press on it to help big chunks form.
    - Let cool for 45 minutes before breaking it into chunks. Store in an air-tight container.
