  ingredients:
    - title: Every day
      ingredients:
        - 50g or rye flour
        - 50ml of water
  directions:
    - title: On the first day
      directions:
        - Mix the flour and the water together. You can theoretically use regular wheat flour but for some reason I've only ever managed to start a sourdough with rye flour, so you've been warned.
        - Let it rest for 24h at room temperature in a clean container. It shouldn't be airtight. You can close it with a cheesecloth to make sure flies won't dive into it.

      directions:
        - Remove the excess dough so that the container is always less than half full.
        - Add flour and water in, make sure it's well mixed together.
        - Repeat the operation every day until the sourdough has started. It's easy to see it has since it doubles in volume six hours or so after "feeding".
    - title: Once the sourdough has started
      directions:
        - Feed it at least once a week (or once every two weeks if you keep it in the fridge).
        - The sourdough should be very active before you can use it to make bread. Make sure to give it one or two feed cycles before baking if you were keeping it hibernating.

Sourdough is a symbiosis between bacteria and yeast that seem to appear ex-nihilo and colonise your rye-and-water mix...
